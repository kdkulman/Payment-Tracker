# Payment-Tracker
 Payment application to take customer payment details and create a text file to store the information in a directory.
 
Notes: This program was created as a software solution for a previous employer. We used an excel sheet to track cash payments so it can be used as reference when doing billing the following day. The excel sheet proved problematic because employees would forget to save the excel sheet, or overwrite it the next day, and new employees struggled to grasp the system we had in place. 

This software solution addressed both issues.
1) It removed the need for an employee to manually save the excel sheet periodically
2) It provided a helpful user interface where "fill in the fields and click submit" is all a new employee has to remember.
