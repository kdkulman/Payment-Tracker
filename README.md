# Payment-Tracker
* Payment application to take customer payment details and create a text file to store the information in a directory.
* Project made in 2018

# The Problem
At a previous job we used a Microsoft Excel document to track customer payment. This was problematic because:
* Employees didn't understand what information to enter into the excel document.
* Employees would forget to save the document and data would be lost.

# The Solution
The payment application addresses both problems.
* It has a user friendly interface with fields that explicitly asks for the required information.
* A submit button immediately saves the information a text file on the computer.


# The Response
* Employees reported it was easier to understand and less of a hassle to save the file everytime
* Our accountant requested a feature to view past payments within the application (great idea)


# Takeaway
* NetBeans generates a lot of gui code so the code files are messy.
* I honestly cringe a little bit looking at my past code, seeing how much my software design skills have improved.
* But this was a helpful software solution I made for real people, I'm a little proud of that.
